knockout-list-slider
====================

Warning - not implemented yet!
--------------------

Slide/cycle through a list of images, menu items etc. Can be configured to render a specific number of items, or try to fit as many as possible in to a container. If not all items are shown, one can cycle through the hidden ones by scrolling, or using the arrow keys at the left and right side of the list.

Config options:
* Which CSS classes to set on the arrows
* Align edge of item to edge of list or allow smooth scrolling
* If items fit only partly in the list, show them partly but with an overlayed element
* CSS class for overlayed elements
